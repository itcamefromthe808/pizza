# pizza

> Random Domino's pizza generator

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

## Heads Up!!
If `ncu` is run or if node modules are updated, make sure to update the urls.json in the dominos pizza api to point to local
Yeah, this is bad, but the only clean way would be to support the API directly in this

## TODO
proper failure states for API calls
